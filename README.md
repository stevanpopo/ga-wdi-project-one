# GA WDI Project One - Gap Year Ninja

This was the first project assignment during my time on General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Course (week3-4). I built a grid-based geography game which requires players to collect letters that make up a capital city name. Players compete against each other to collect the most cities possible to win.

## Brief
Design a two player game that works in the users browser. Players must be able to win and lose. The game should be built using HTML, CSS and Javascript (JQuery). We were given a week to build the project.

## Build Process
This was the first project were we worked independently for an extended period of time. Whilst we had guidance from our course leaders, the focus was on planning our own project from beginning to end and solving our own problems.

### Inspiration
In order to gain inspiration for my game I:
* Listed my areas of interest and brainstormed how they could be turned into games.
* Viewed complete game projects from our previous cohort.
* Looked at existing games on miniclip.com.
* Thought of classic board games and how they might be played as a digital game.

### Plan
I wanted to create a game that had an educational/learning element to it. I chose to move forward with a geography game that required users to correctly guess capital cities. Additionally, they would have to race to collect the letters that formed those cities by moving around a grid as quickly as possible.

Given the time constraints, I was keen to get to the build phase of the project as quickly as possible. I was also aware that a good plan would prevent me from running into issues later on. I created a list of how I wanted the
